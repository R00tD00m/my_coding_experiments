Here, I have utilized the power of LLM AI (ChatGPT-4) to help me create a Python-based program that searches a given directory for specific file types, then saves the output to an HTML file with clickable links that the user can navigate through and preview.

I then used the Tkinter Python library to create an executable with a GUI, allowing the end user to better interact with the program.

Currently, this project is strictly experimental, and I am still learning Python, so please... don't judge me! :D

The initial idea came to me when my son and I were brainstorming efficient ways to search for hidden, juicy .wav files among the collection of installed games in our various Steam directories. We all have multiple Steam directories... right? :D 

We wanted to find these files to use them in Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) programs like FL Studio and Ableton Live for music production. 

I am sure there are better ways to accomplish this, and I am even more certain that someone else has already done nearly the exact same thing. However, I am still learning to code, and I figured this would be a good way to get my feet wet with Python.
